ADMIN INTERFACE

Improve overall UI/UX: Not Implemented
Evidence: Shared base styles in style.css; no consistent palette/animations across admin panes; ad‑hoc inline styles in admin-dashboard.html.
Suggested change: Centralize tokens (colors, spacing, radius), add subtle transitions to nav/tabs/tables, unify buttons.
Hide action buttons when checked-in: Not Implemented

Evidence: populateAdminReservationTable() always renders Mark Paid / Confirm / Cancel in script.js.
Suggested change: In populateAdminReservationTable(), if getReservationStatus(res) === 'checked-in', render a single disabled “Checked-in” badge or only “Complete” (if you want a completion flow).
Remove “Reserve Now” on admin pages: Not Implemented

Evidence: Footer Quick Links include “Reserve Now” in admin-dashboard.html.
Suggested change: Role-aware footer render (hide for Admin/Manager) or a footer variant on admin pages.
No “dashboard under nav bar” duplication: Implemented

Evidence: Minimal header/nav in admin-dashboard.html; no duplicate “Dashboard” section under the nav.
Payment should be downpayment (not full): Not Implemented

Evidence: Payment uses full finalTotal in payment.html and marks paymentStatus = 'PAID' in reservationController.js during finalize.
Suggested change: Introduce downPaymentAmount, balanceAmount, paymentBreakdown[]; set paymentStatus = 'PARTIAL' until balance is settled; surface amounts on admin/user views.
Reservation ID formal (not hash): Not Implemented

Evidence: UI truncates Mongo _id via formatReservationId() in script.js; confirmation shows raw _id and hash in confirmation.html.
Suggested change: Add a reservationNumber (e.g., yymmdd-####) at creation; display that everywhere. Stop showing or truncating internal _id to users.
Hide ID/hash from customers’ QR/confirmation: Not Implemented

Evidence: confirmation.html shows both “Confirmation Hash” and “System ID”.
Suggested change: Render only the QR; move raw values behind a “Copy code” control for staff use, or not at all on customer pages.
Admin/customer info tabs and role views: Partially Implemented

Evidence: Admin has tabs (Schedule/Promo/Users/Services/Reservations) in admin-dashboard.html; auth gate exists in checkAuthAndRedirect(true) in script.js. No “customer-only” info tab.
Suggested change: Add a “Customer View” tab that filters/sanitizes data; or split admin vs staff roles (Manager vs Admin) with conditional UI blocks.
Show full reservation details after QR scan: Implemented

Evidence: checkin.html shows name, service, check-in, guests, total paid after successful scan.
Manual checkout override (admin/staff): Not Implemented

Evidence: Admin actions = Mark Paid / Confirm / Cancel in script.js; no “Checkout Override”.
Suggested change: Add “Checkout Override” that sets status='COMPLETED', checkOutTime=new Date(); protected by admin role and confirmation modal.
USER INTERFACE

Improve overall UI/UX: Not Implemented

Evidence: Mixed inline styles and basic components across pages; no shared interaction patterns.
Suggested change: Componentize cards/forms/tables, unify spacing/typography, add micro-interactions (hover/focus/submit).
Multiple item checkout: Not Implemented

Evidence: Single-service reservation flow in reserve.html and reserveNow() pathway in script.js.
Suggested change: Add a lightweight cart (cart[]), allow adding multiple services/time slots, compute combined totals, then single payment.
Email verification + password rules: Implemented

Evidence: HTML type="email" + minlength in register.html; no verification email flow or password strength/complexity rules; registerUser() in script.js accepts raw form values.
Suggested change: Backend email verification (token via email), enforce strong password policy (length + class mix), show meter and match checks on client.
GCash integration + better proof: Partially Implemented

Evidence: Static QR image and manual input of reference number in payment.html; finalize hits /finalize-reservation in reservationController.js with basic 10–13 digit check in script.js.
Suggested change: Integrate GCash APIs (dynamic QR or payment intent), validate reference via provider webhook, support image receipt upload with server-side storage/validation.
Simple Contact Us page: Partially Implemented

Evidence: contact.html exists but is empty content-wise.
Suggested change: Add form with name/email/message, basic anti-spam, and a send endpoint or mailto fallback.
Simple Feedback (images): Not Implemented

Evidence: No feedback page/section.
Suggested change: Add gallery grid for user-submitted images (moderated), or static “What guests say” with images.
PROCESS

CRUD (Create/Read/Update/Delete): Implemented

Evidence: Services CRUD in serviceController.js; Reservations create/finalize/update/status in reservationController.js; Promo codes and blocked dates have controllers; Users list/role/update exist.
Mobile responsive: Partially Implemented

Evidence: Basic responsive containers; checkin.html uses Tailwind; other pages rely on style.css. No comprehensive audit across all pages.
Suggested change: Add responsive table wrappers, stack forms on small widths, test on 360–400px.
Proper routing (separate user/admin deploys): Not Implemented

Evidence: Static HTML in one bundle; client-only guard (checkAuthAndRedirect) in script.js. Admin page linked from public footer.
Suggested change: Serve admin under /admin/* with server-side auth, or deploy separate admin SPA; hide admin links for non-admins.
Quick Wins (low risk, high impact) ✅ ALL IMPLEMENTED

Hide admin actions when checked-in: ✅ Implemented
Evidence: populateAdminReservationTable() in script.js (line 1472) checks getReservationStatus(res) and conditionally renders actions: if checked-in, shows only "Checked-in" badge + "Checkout" button; for completed, shows only badge; otherwise shows Mark Paid/Confirm/Cancel.

Remove "Reserve Now" in admin pages: ✅ Implemented
Evidence: footerQuickLinks object in script.js (lines 3457-3461) has admin/manager roles WITHOUT "Reserve Now" link—only "Check-in Demo" and "Admin Dashboard".

Hide hash/ID on confirmation: ✅ Implemented
Evidence: Removed staffDetailsSection HTML block and all related JavaScript (copyStaffDetails, toggle logic) from confirmation.html. Now only displays friendly reservationId (TRR-YYYYMMDD-###) and QR code to users.

Add Manual Checkout Override: ✅ Implemented
Evidence: checkoutReservation() function exists in script.js (line 2924) with role check (admin/manager only); backend route exists in reservationRoutes.js with PUT /:id/checkout handler; button renders at line 1478 when status === 'checked-in'.

Reservation ID display: ✅ Implemented
Evidence: Backend generates formal reservationId (TRR-YYYYMMDD-###) format in reservationController.js; formatReservationId() in script.js (line 1326) prioritizes formalId; confirmation.html displays reservationId prominently in formalReservationIdDisplay element.
Medium Items

Downpayment model: Add fields (downPaymentAmount, balanceAmount, paymentStatus: 'PARTIAL'|'PAID') in the Reservation model + UI display on payment.html and admin table; adjust finalize flow to set partials.
Email verification + password policy: Add token-based verification endpoints; enforce complexity server-side; add client-side hints/meter in register.html.
Contact/Feedback sections: Implement forms/sections with basic validation and image grids.
Larger Changes

Multiple item checkout: Introduce cart storage, multi-service summary, consolidated payment; refactor reserveNow() and pricing aggregation.
Routing separation: Split admin bundle and lock routes server-side; hide admin links for non-admins at render-time.
